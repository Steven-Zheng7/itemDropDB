# Item Drop Database Project for CMSC508

### Description

This is a database that stores item drop information from a variety of different games. It will only include the most important information such as drop location, stats, NPC that it comes from, and etc. This project design will be completed using quarto, mermaid, graphviz and rendered as an html file to view. We are hoping to develope this as a web application and the database will operate as the back end.
