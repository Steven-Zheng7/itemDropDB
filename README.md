# Item Drop Database Project for CMSC508

### Description

This is a database that stores item drop information from a variety of different games. It will only include the most important information such as drop location, stats, NPC that it comes from, and etc. This project design will be completed using quarto, mermaid, graphviz and rendered as an html file to view. We are hoping to develope this as a web application and the database will operate as the back end. We will use flask API as a communication software to communicate between browser and our database. We will also use SQL statments to construct our database in a ddl file.

### Project Overview

Steven Zheng and Shashank Mallipeddi<br/>
Our project will be focus on designing a working database that will contain drop information of items accross various of games. This project is aim to assist gamers, game developers and etc to easily find information about a certain game's item and reduce the amount of web surfing the individual has to go through.

#### Installation and Running the Project

The Code is avaliable on Github via the link above. To get a copy of this repo, install and perform a git clone command using this URL. So far, this project is in its early phase and we have not develope any sort of running code nor front end to capture user input. We will update this README as we progress the project and hopefull you can expect a working application soon.

#### How to use the project
First, run the flask file in a python environment. Then open a browser and download an extension that can edit the header request to match the key in the flask_db.py file. Then run the flask file and use the browser to make request according to the api documentation.

#### Final Reflection
In reflecting on our project, we decided that the biggest thing we could improve on is improving user experience by adding images and other visuals. If we could find a place to host a large amount of picture data, we could have images of all the items (and maybe even other things like locations) show up along with other information. This would help in identifying the objects and is another step towards our goal of reducing research time for gamers. We also thought adding visuals to the UI would be useful in improving usability and aesthetics.
Possible directions we can take this in the future is making the database more interactive by adding a tracking aspect to it. This would allow individual users to select and keep track of items they currently have or previously obtained in the games. This would be updated as the player plays and collects more items.
